Based on SpringBoot2.x and SpringCloud, the front-end and back-end separated multi-tenant system architecture microservice development platform mPaaS (Microservice PaaS) is used to develop, test, operate, and maintain an open source framework for tenant business, which can effectively reduce the technical threshold, reduce research and development costs, and improve Development efficiency.

:anger: :facepunch:  _The system is under development, it is expected to complete the overall architecture in **two months**.

**Core functions**:
- **Quick Development**: The engineering development framework can automatically generate initialization code. The framework also provides a modular development mode, which is suitable for collaborative development by multiple people.
- **Performance optimization**: Supports one-stop, full-process creation and management of operational activities, loading intelligent delivery capabilities, which can maximize operational efficiency and conversion effects, and help business growth.
- **Closed loop of digital operation**: All components have undergone high concurrency, high traffic inspection, and have been deeply optimized for weak networks, keep-alives, containers, etc., and are compatible with complex client situations
- **Flexible use mode**: The framework and components do not have strong dependencies, can be divided and combined, and are flexible and maneuverable. Each component can provide powerful functions independently, and can also cooperate with each other to optimize the user experience and play a greater role.
